## 🚀 Overview

This platform is a mission-critical, enterprise-grade food delivery system featuring four fully integrated, role-based access portals:
- **🛒 Customer App**: Discovery engine mapping out thousands of localized menu items, featuring real-time cart constraints, category exploration, and secure Razorpay checkout.
- **🏬 Partner Portal**: Isolated dashboards for Restaurant Owners to execute fast CRUD on daily menus, handle incoming operational tickets, and control storefront configurations.
- **🛵 Delivery Interface**: A dedicated mobile-responsive logistics layer allowing agents to claim geo-fenced dispatches, track fulfillment payouts, and flag live milestone updates.
- **🛡️ Admin Console**: Oversight of the entire ecosystem, including user governance, financial auditing, system diagnostics, and master platform categories.

## 🔄 End-to-End System Workflows (Deep Analysis)

Savor operates on a robust, multi-layered architecture designed to strictly synchronize four distinct user archetypes in real-time. Below is the deep-dive analysis of the core operational flow paradigms:

### 1. 🛒 Customer Journey & Discovery Flow
- **Authentication:** Secure JWT-based onboarding and session management with silent rotation.
- **Two-Layer Discovery Architecture:**
  - **Global Layer:** Browse ecosystem via top-level `Cuisines` (e.g., Arabian, South Indian, Desserts).
  - **Local Layer:** Inside a restaurant, the menu is strictly grouped by `Restaurant Categories` (e.g., "Must Try", "Specials").
- **Cart Constraints:** Persistent local state ensuring single-restaurant cart integrity (prevents cross-restaurant checkout conflicts).
- **Checkout Pipeline:** Interfaced with Razorpay for rapid, secure payment verification and order instantiation.
- **Telemetry:** Real-time polling logic to track the order lifecycle (Pending → Preparing → Out for Delivery → Delivered).

### 2. 🏬 Restaurant Fulfillment Pipeline
- **Command Center:** High-level metrics visualization (revenue, active tickets, and aggregate volume).
- **Data Governance:** Strict hierarchical enforcement of `Restaurant → Internal Categories → Menu Items` preventing data leakage across tenants.
- **Lifecycle Management:**
  - Listen for `Pending` orders and trigger `Accept`.
  - Transition state to `Preparing` during kitchen operations.
  - Finalize internal ops by flagging as `Ready for Delivery` to trigger logistic dispatch.
- **Atomic Integrity:** Profile details and financial settings use Django `@transaction.atomic` to prevent partial-save database corruption.

### 3. 🛵 Delivery Agent Logistics Matrix
- **Agent Presence:** Bi-modal toggle for `Available/Offline` status broadcast.
- **Dispatch Queue:** Agents ingest orders isolated to their geo-fenced deployment parameter (e.g., Kochi agents only see Kochi dispatches).
- **Execution Workflow:**
  - Claim unassigned payload from network.
  - Engage `Out For Delivery` status upon restaurant handover.
  - Fire `Delivered` endpoint to close the operational loop and instantly calculate earnings payload.

### 4. 👑 System Administration Oversight
- **Ecosystem Governance:** God-mode capabilities across the entire data mesh (Customers, Partners, Fleet).
- **High-Volume Pagination:** Enterprise-grade server-side pagination to parse 3,000+ menu items gracefully.
- **Financial Audit:** Absolute visibility into total Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), Razorpay transaction statuses, and network saturation metrics.

---

## 🛠️ API Documentation (Postman)

To facilitate rapid testing and integration audits, a comprehensive **Postman Collection** is included in the repository.

- **Collection Path**: `backend/postman.json`
- **Setup**:
  1. Import the `postman.json` file into your Postman workspace.
  2. Configure an environment variable `base_url` pointing to your local or live backend.
  3. All endpoints for **Auth rotation**, **Order status management**, and **Multi-tenant profile updates** are pre-configured with example payloads.

## 🔒 Security & Performance Standards

This project implements professional-level security protocols required for modern web applications:
- **Silent JWT Rotation**: Access tokens expire every 60 minutes; refresh tokens (7 days) are rotated silently via axios interceptors.
- **Atomic Transactions**: Nested profile updates use `@transaction.atomic` to ensure data integrity.
- **Hardenened Settings**: Production flags enabled for `HSTS`, `SSL Redirect`, and `SECURE_COOKIES`.
- **Environment Aware**: No hardcoded API URLs. Uses `VITE_API_URL` consistently for seamless Dev/Prod transitions.
