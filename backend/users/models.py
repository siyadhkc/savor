    WHY EmailField instead of CharField?
    EmailField validates that the value is a proper email
    format (contains @, valid domain, etc.) automatically.
    CharField would accept "notanemail" as valid — wrong.

    WHY unique=True?
    Since we use email as USERNAME_FIELD for login,
    two users with the same email would break authentication.
    unique=True enforces this at the DATABASE level —
    not just form validation, but a real DB constraint.

    BEGINNER MISTAKE: Only validating uniqueness in the
    serializer but not at model level. Always enforce
    critical constraints at BOTH levels — model + serializer.
