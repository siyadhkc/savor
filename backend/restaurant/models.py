    WHY a separate Restaurant model?
    In a food delivery app, restaurants are independent entities.

    Separating it into its own app keeps code organized —
    this is the Django principle of "separation of concerns".

    WHY ImageField?
    ImageField is a FileField that validates the uploaded
    file is actually an image. It requires Pillow (which we installed).

        default ordering on models that will be listed.
